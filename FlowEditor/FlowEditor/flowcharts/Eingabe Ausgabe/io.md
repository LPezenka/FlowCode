# Input and Output
Input and ouput are fundamental operations that are required for most user interaction. The keywords for either operation can be user-defined. 

## Usage
Inputs follow the form: v = Eingabe
- where "Eingabe" is the german word for input. This keyword can be changed in the Config class
- variable type on the left hand side is automatically inferred by the code interpreter

Outputs follow the form: Ausgabe: v
- where "Ausgabe" is the german word for output. This keyword can be changed in the Config class
- string literals need to be delimited with double quotation marks, i.e., "this is a string", whereas *this is not*

## Examples

The following example flowcharts are included in the "Flowcharts" folder:

### template-strings
This example demonstrates how to read an integer variable, generate a template string and display it on screen
Complexity: Easy

The following concepts are implemented:
- input / output (displaying the message)
- template strings (to generate the output message)
