# Functions

## Usage
Functions are modelled by
- First, creating a Terminal Node and setting Type to "Start"
-- Input parameters are declared in the textbox "Input Params", with no type declaration. 
-- Types are inferred at runtime
- Secondly, implementing the function body as usual
- Thirdly, creating a Terminal Node and setting Type to "End"
-- The return variable is specified in the textbox "return Variable" 
- Finally, creating a Process Call Node and calling the defined function in the form FunctionName(Params)
